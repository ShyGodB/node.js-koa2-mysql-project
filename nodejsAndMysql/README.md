# node.js-koa2-mysql-project
A small project written using node.js,koa2 and mysql 

**method of use**
Open the terminal, **CD** to your target directory, and use the following command to clone the repository to your local directory:
> git clone https://github.com/ShyGodB/node.js-koa2-mysql-project.git

Then you need to go to the project folder you want to open with the CD command
OK, Then you must install the necessary modules by use :
> npm install

Next, you can start server by :
> npm start 

Note that here I use a module called **nodemon** that can help us restart the service while saving the file without having to do it manually, I think it is very useful, and hope you like it, too. Of course, if you don't like this, you can also manually start the service.

Finally, What I want to say is I hope these can help you.But, these items are not perfect, if you have any questions or suggestions, please advise and I will do my best to meet your expectations. Friends, let's make progress together !
